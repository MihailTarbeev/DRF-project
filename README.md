<h1 align="center">Hi there!

<h3 align="center">This is my project, where I realized some DRF opportunities</h3>
<br>
<p>In this small project I realized:</p>
<ul>
  <li>API with able to use methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE</li>
  <li>Session-based authorization</li>
  <li>JWT-based authorization</li>
  <li>Permissions</li>
  <li>Pagination</li>
</ul>
<p>I used famous software engineers as data</p>
<p>Command to install the necessary dependencies:<br>
  <b>pip install -r requirements.txt</b></p>
<p>You can run the server locally and execute the command in the terminal:<br>
  <b>python manage.py runserver</b></p>
